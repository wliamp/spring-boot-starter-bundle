# 🔧 Spring Boot Starter Bundle

This repository provides modular Spring Boot starter libraries for building scalable and secure backend services, designed for production-ready integration and extensibility.

## 📁 Starters

- [Reactive Algorithm](./algorithm) – Provides a stateless foundation for implementing and composing core algorithms in a reactive style. Designed to integrate with various data structures, supporting asynchronous processing, extensibility, and reuse across different domains.
  
- [Reactive Payment Provider](./provider-payment) – Modular integration layer for connecting with external payment gateways. Supports asynchronous request handling, secure transaction flow, and unified abstraction across multiple providers.

- [Reactive Verify Provider](./provider-verify) – Service for verifying third-party authentication and identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, phone OTP), ensures secure validation before issuing tokens or granting access.

- [Reactive Token](./token) – Provides token generation, validation, and lifecycle management for secure inter-service communication.
  
Each module is independently runnable and documented in its own README.md file.
