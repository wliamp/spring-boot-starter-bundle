# 🔧 Spring Boot Starter Library

This repository contains modular Spring Boot starter libraries designed for backend service development, learning, and experimentation.

## 📁 Projects

- [Game Logic Starter](starter-algorithm) – Stateless service for handling core game logic, including player actions and in-game event processing, independent of session state.

- [Token Handler Starter](./starter-token) – Provides token generation, validation, and lifecycle management for secure inter-service communication.
  
Each module is independently runnable and documented in its own README.md file.
